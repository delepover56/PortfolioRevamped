          Hey there! I'm M. Taha Khan â€“ a passionate front-end web developer
          from the bustling city of Karachi! With a knack for crafting
          interactive and engaging web experiences, I bring your ideas to life
          using clean HTML, sleek CSS, and dynamic JavaScript.
          <br />
          <br />
          Iâ€™ve also got hands-on experience with WordPress and PHP, building
          powerful websites that are both user-friendly and visually striking.
          Right now, Iâ€™m diving deep into React.js, sharpening my skills in
          modern JavaScript frameworks, with Next.js on my radar next.
          <br />
          <br />
          Whether itâ€™s a custom-coded solution or a slick WordPress site, Iâ€™m
          your friendly neighborhood developer, ready to make your vision a
          reality. Let's build something awesome together! ðŸš€
